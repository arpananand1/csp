/* Function:
    void ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_Initialize(void)

   Summary:
    Initializes given instance of the TWIHS peripheral.
	
   Description:
    This function initializes the given instance of the TWIHS peripheral as
    configured by the user from within the MCC.

   Precondition:
    None.
	
   Parameters:
    None.
	
   Returns:
    None

   Example:
    <code>
    TWIHS1_Initialize();
    </code>

   Remarks:
    Stops the TWIHS if it was already running and reinitializes it.

/* Function:
    void ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_CallbackRegister(TWIHS_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t contextHandle)
	
   Summary:
    Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the 
    given TWIHS's transfer events occur.

   Description:
    This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" 
    when the given TWIHS's transfer events occur. It also passes a context value 
    (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the
    function when it is called.

   Precondition:
    ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_Initialize must have been called for the associated TWIHS instance.

   Parameters:
    callback - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined 
	by the TWIHS_CALLBACK data type.

    context - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function 
	identified by the callback parameter.
  
   Returns:
    None.

   Example:
    <code>
    ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_CallbackRegister(MyTWIHSCallback, &myData);
    </code>

   Remarks:
    The context parameter is ignored if the pointer passed is NULL.
    To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter.
    See the TWIHS_CALLBACK type definition for additional information.

   Summary:
    Reads data from the slave.

   Description:
    This function reads the data of size in bytes equal to length into pdata buffer

    True - Read request was successful.
    False - Read request has failed.


   Example:
    <code>

   Summary:
    Writes data onto the slave.

   Description:
    This function writes the data from pdata buffer of size in bytes equal to 
	length onto the slave with given address. Master will generate Stop 
	condition after completion of the write.

   Precondition:
    ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_Initialize must have been called for the associated TWIHS instance.

   Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.
	pdata   - pointer to source data buffer
	length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes.
	
   Returns:
    Request status.
    True - Request was successful.
    False - Request has failed.

   Example:

   Summary:
    Write and Read data from Slave.

   Description:
    This function writes data from wdata buffer to the slave of given address and
	of size(in bytes) equal to wlength. Master then generates a repeated start and
	do a read operation. Read operation reads data into rdata buffer of size(in
    bytes) equal to rlength from the slave of given address. Master generates a stop
	condition after reading the data.

   Precondition:
    ${TWIHS_INSTANCE_NAME}_Initialize must have been called for the associated TWIHS instance.

   Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.
	wdata   - pointer to write data buffer
	wlength - write data length in bytes.
	rdata   - pointer to read data buffer.
	rlength - read data length in bytes.
  
   Returns:
    Request status.
    True - Request was successful.
    False - Request has failed.

   Example:
    <code>
	    uint8_t myTxData [NUM_BYTES] = {'1', '0', ' ', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'E', 'S', '!', '!'};
